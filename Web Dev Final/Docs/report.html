            Introduction: The website is designed for video game developers who work full time, who often find themself in the long-term loophole of learning to make videogames, instead of making games. 

            <b><br><br>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. These could include guest speakers,
                other websites, artists, developers etc.</b>

            <br><br>There are various resources out on the internet that I visited over the years in my game development journey, some of them I found especially helpful was mentioned here-  
            </p>
            <ul class="sectionTag text-mid">
                <br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas Brush, game developer and creator of video games called coma and pinstripe - After I found his channel in youtube I watched a lot of his videos on marketing, production of videogames and I was inspired to make my 1st game.</li> 

                <br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Wahle, also a game developer and has a youtube channel - David 1st opened my eyes about the possibility of making a video game for living so I followed him religiously and learned a lot from him.</li>

                <br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GDC - GDC is Game Developers Conference, it invites everyone who achieved great feats in any field related to video games to give a talk and share their journey with fellow devs.</li>
            </ul>    
            <p class="sectionTag text-mid">
            <br>I hope this site does similar to those in search of the truth about how to make it in the game industry while working a full-time job.

            <br><br><b>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</b>
            </p>    
            <ul class="sectionTag text-mid">
                <br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used alternative (alt) text for Images -This is an important one, cause I believe a lot of people have a visual disability so they use audio prompter to understand the content of the website. </li>

            
                <br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used sufficient colour contrast between Text and Background - This one is for who have troubling eyesight and cant distinguish colour much. By adding huge contrast it enables them to read easily. Dark background and light text are always relaxing for eyes.</li> 

                <br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All content is easily accessible and for those of my visitors who have epilepsy, video content has autoplay turned off, so they don't get triggered.</li> 
            </ul>
            <p class="sectionTag text-mid">
            <br><br><b>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</b>
            </p>    
            <ul class="sectionTag text-mid">
                <br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tested the outgoing links from all the pages - Since, I don't have much outgoing link, on;y few goes to youtube and other some image sources. they are tested and worked fine when I tested them.</li>

                <br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tested all internal links - This is an important one, I checked all links that are linked to and from the index, articles sites and all works well.</li>

                <br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Checked if there are any orphan pages - There is no orphan page.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="sectionTag text-mid">
            <br><br><b>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did.that (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).</b>
            </p>    
            <ul class="sectionTag text-mid">
                <br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsiveness and media queries - While I had little exp with web development, I never learnt how to use media queries and make a website responsive for desktop, tablet and mobile.</li>

                <br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightbox - This is my 1st time using a js library. lightbox is an advanced library created by Lokesh Dhakar to create a beautiful carousel.</li>

                <br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embedding video in the site.</li>
            </ul>    
            <p class="sectionTag text-mid">
            <br><br><b>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why? What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</b>
            </p>    
            <ul class="sectionTag text-mid">
                <br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theme was done nicely and it is consistent  -  Its the theme I am proud of most, cause it looks beautiful in my eyes. Since I designed the site for myself, I used the colour pallet I liked most. I also the border, it has smooth edges giving it a polished premium feel. </li>

                <br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animation and responsiveness transition could be improved - Due to the current situation, I couldn't work on the project as much as I wished. There is a lack o animation and I am aware of that, if I had more time I would add more animation and make the responsive transition a bit more smooth.</li>

                <br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing to do differently, it is perfect as it is.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="sectionTag text-mid">
            <br><br><b>What resources were used when creating your work? You should list here any sources of information,
            libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to create your site. You should also reference any code you've
            used by inserting comments at the start of the scripts.</b>
            </p>    
            <ul class="sectionTag text-mid">
                <br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youtube was used to learn theme design and responsiveness  - While as much as I would like to say I invented the theme, it was inspired by youtube tutorials. I coded all of it myself but inspirations are taken from countless youtube tutorials.</li>

                <br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightbox by Lokesh Dhakar was used to create a carousel.</li>
